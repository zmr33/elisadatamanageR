Description: This package takes excel files output by the Gen 5 microplate 
    reading software, combines them, extracts the data from each 8x12 table
    and transforms it into long format. It checks the plate controls per plate,
    and then it looks at the replicate data between samples (mean/%cv, etc.). 
    There is room for additional analyses if needed.
