# elisadatamanageR
R package for ETL pipeline for ELISA Gen 5 software. 

This will contain all the code necessary to automatically import, merge, clean, 
and run preliminary analysis on outputs from the Gen 5 Microplate reading software

This is built for ELISA data specifically, for O. volvulus serological surveillance. 
Data needs to be set up a certain way in your Gen 5 output for the code to work properly.

I don't have access to the Gen5 microplate reading software so keep that in mind.
